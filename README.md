# Steam Clone

> Team117-LARP (Leon Wang, Aaron De Los Santos, Raymond Bellin, Pinakin Kanade)

For our CS 411 project, we want to devise a cleaner, minimalistic, and more intuitive version of the Steam website store dedicated for browsing games.

# Interface Demo

## Server
Make sure that the database is online and your local IP is registered on it.

To run the server, have Java SDK and Maven installed, `cd` to `server/` and in terminal run `mvn spring-boot:run`. If you don't have Maven you can run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` instead.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080.
