# Steam Clone

> Team117-LARP (Leon Wang, Aaron De Los Santos, Raymond Bellin, Pinakin Kanade)

For our CS 411 project, we want to devise a cleaner, minimalistic, and more intuitive version of the Steam website store dedicated for browsing games.

## Interface Demo

Make sure you have `npm` and `nodeJS` installed on your system, pull the project and in terminal run `npm install` to install all necessary packages. 

Connect to the db. Then start the app by running `npm start` and `node server.js` in different terminals and check `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
