# Steam Clone

For our CS 411 project, we want to devise a cleaner, minimalistic, and more intuitive version of the Steam website store dedicated for browsing games.

# Interface Demo
Make sure that you have npm, NodeJS, Java SDK, and Maven installed.

Pull the repo and go to `/app` and run `npm install` to install frontend packages.

If you made backend changes in `server/` or want to test the whole app, go to `/server` and run `mvn spring-boot:run`, or `./mvnw spring-boot:run` if you don't have Maven. Also make sure that the database is online and your local IP is registered on it.

If you made frontend changes in `/app`, save them by running `npm run build`.

To test only the frontend, go to `/app` and run `npm run dev`.
